# Masterthesis
Python Code used for the thesis "Improving classification of the P300 component in a tactile brain-computer interface for a patient with ALS"
#### This repository contains all python code used to manipulate and classify the data of the masterthesis project.

## Sessionwise_mne.ipynb :
was used to transform the recorded data stored in .dat files into mne.Raws for further processing in python.

## workspace.py :
was used to investigate the data and test different classification approaches.

## data_prep.py :
contains functions called in workspace for: 
- data investigation
- preparing the data for classification
- evaluation of the classification results

## 1_Prepare_Data.ipynb :
was used to rearange the data so it could be more easily analyzed.

## 2_Analyze_Data.ipynb :
was used to visualize the data and for quick analysis.
